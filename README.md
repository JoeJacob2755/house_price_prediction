## General Information
- Project is done as assignment for Advance ML at IIIT B/UpGrad.
- The project aims to create lasso and reidge regression models for predicting the sale price of houses in US based on numerous variables?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - The business problems are
        - To identify the most important variables that affect the price of houses
        - To find how much they impact the prices of houses
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - the data set being used is provided by UpGrad/IIIT-B from Kaggle. It contains house sale price data and 81 variables that affect the price

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Ridge regression gives a marginally better model than lasso

- The R2 Socres are
    - Ridge: 66.51
    - Lasso: 66.47
- The most important variables are
    - Lot Area
    - GrLivArea
    - Grage Area
    - Age of House
    - Age of remodelling
    - Overal condition of house
    - Number of baths
    - Porch Area
